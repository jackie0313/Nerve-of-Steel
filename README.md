# Nerve of Steel
## In-class exercise 4: Nerve of Steel
##### This is a party game called Nerve of Steel written in Python.   
##### Nerve of Steel is a common party game where players will sit together in a circle. When the game starts, every player will stand up and wait. Between 5 to 25 seconds the game will end. Players will decide when to sit down in anticipation of the end. Whoever is last to sit down will win the game. 
### Features 
##### The Nerve of Steel.py file uses the modules time, random, matplotlib.pyplot, and PIL. The time library has a sleep function that will pause the script for a specified amount of time. The random library is used to randomly generate numbers. The matplotlib library is used for plotting and data visualization. Finally, the pillow library is used to easily display images.  
### How to use
##### In this repository, there are three files consisting of one python script named Nerve-of-Steel.py and two jpg images named stand.jpg and end.jpg. To run the game, simply open the python file in a development environment such as Spyder and hit run. Once the script begins, an image informing users to stand up will appear. Then after 5 to 25 seconds, the game will come to an end and a times up image will appear signaling the end.
